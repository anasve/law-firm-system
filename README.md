## Law Project

This repository contains the **law** project, which is intended for legal-related software (for example: contract drafting, case management, document automation, or other legal workflows).  
You can freely update this description later to precisely match your actual project.

## Repository structure

At the moment, this folder only contains the `README.md` file.  
After you add your code and other assets, it is recommended to document the structure here, for example:

- `src`: application source code.
- `docs`: additional documentation.

## Prerequisites

Since there is no code yet, there are no strict prerequisites.  
After you decide on your stack (e.g. **Node.js**, **Python**, **.NET**, etc.), update this section. For example:

- **Node.js**: version 18 or newer.
- **Python**: version 3.10 or newer.

## Getting started

Update these commands according to the technology you choose. Examples:

```bash
# Example for a Node.js project
npm install
npm run dev
```

or:

```bash
# Example for a Python project
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Features (suggested, editable)

You can adjust this list to match your real idea:

- **Case management**: track cases, clients, and lawyers.
- **Document management**: store contracts, legal memos, and templates.
- **Calendar and reminders**: manage hearings, deadlines, and important dates.
